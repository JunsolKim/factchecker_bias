# factchecker_bias

## Implemented
  - Politifact cralwer - factchecking articles (politifact_crawler.ipynb)

## To be implemented
  - We first need to run "Politifact cralwer - factchecking articles"
  - Politifact crawler - Speaker information (e.g., https://www.politifact.com/personalities/fred-thompson/)
  - Politifact crawler - Factchecker information (e.g., https://www.politifact.com/staff/louis-jacobson/)
  - Matching speaker information with political affiliations (LIAR, Wikipedia)
    - Can we think of any other source of party affiliation dataset?
